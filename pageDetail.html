                A breathless session saw a quite staggering 23 cars blanketed by
                just eight tenths of a second with positions changing at almost
                every moment. Such was the competitiveness that the
                ballast-laden VW of Jason Plato could only manage 22nd on the
                grid, although the double champion has cited an as yet unknown
                problem with his Team BMR RCIB Insurance machine. Jason Plato,
                right after the race:

                "Something fundamental has happened today because it was a
                completely different car to the one we had in free practice"
              </p>
              <p class="content-text">
                Sam Tordoff looked to have stolen pole position from under the
                nose of Motorbase Performances Mat Jackson, with the latter
                combination going for their first ever P1 in qualifying.
                Tordoff’s BMW 125i M Sport flashed across the line to move to
                the summit with just two minutes to go.

                Tordoff and Jackson held on to second and third, while WSR’s Rob
                Collard moved into fourth after recovering from an off-track
                excursion during one of his late flyers. Gordon Shedden who had
                dominated both practice sessions earlier in the day had to
                settle for fifth, just 0.005s off the second row pace. It could
                have been better for the Scotsman but one of his fastest
                attempts was scuppered when his Honda Yuasa Racing team-mate
                Matt Neal went off, bringing about one of red flag periods. The
                2012 champion shook his head as he returned to the pitlane,
                possibly in the knowledge that his best opportunity had been
                wasted.

              <p class="content-text">
                Regular Knockhill front row starter Rob Austin could only manage
                sixth this time around, but it still represented his best
                performance of the season in the Exocet AlcoSense Audi A4. Neal
                held on to seventh despite his spin.

                MG’s Andrew Jordan took eighth with his last attempt also ruined
                after he ran wide and into the gravel in his Pirtek-backed MG6.

                Ninth wouldn’t normally be something to celebrate for Colin
                Turkington, but the reigning champion was Team BMR RCIB
                Insurance’s top performer and he also maintained his record of
                qualifying inside the top ten of every 2015 event. Adam Morgan’s
                WIX Racing Mercedes was relegated to tenth by Turkington with
                the duo split by just 0.001s. Unbelievably close gaps continued
                throughout the order with the likes of Snetterton race winner
                Jack Goff, Aron Smith and Plato.

                Plato was another to abort his last flyer attempt following a
                trip through the gravel and the double champion had to settle
                for the lowest grid position in his BTCC career the championship
                leader will have it all to do from 22nd on the grid. Plato has
                suggested, however, that he’ll likely start from the pitlane as
                he did at Croft earlier this season in a bid to grab pole
                position for race two.

                He continued: “It’s dangerous to expect anything, I knew coming
                into the weekend that we’d be strong, but to be fair I’ve had to
                get my head around the circuit, it’s been a long time since I
                raced here! A few things have changed, the kerbs are different
                through the chicane for example which makes a big difference.
                The track was going up and down in grip level, and while it
                didn’t drop massively it was pretty greasy and in those
                conditions it’s very easy to make a mistake. I knew that we had
                to be out there and get that free lap, and we stole it right at
                the end which is mega really.

                Gordon Shedden made it a significant double in the second
                practice session as the Scotsman fired out a warning ahead of
                this afternoon’s Dunlop MSA British Touring Car Championship
                qualifying session.

                It’s important that we do it when it matters though and that’s
                in qualifying. It’s going okay but I’m sure the others will find
                some time too. Honda Yuasa Racing’s Shedden became the first and
                only driver to break the 52 second barrier in either of the
                practice sessions and now his Civic Type R, which shed some
                success ballast coming into the event, looks in particularly
                good shape for the weekend.

              <p class="content-text">
                It was another Honda one-two in the second practice session, but
                maybe not the combination you will have expected as the
                Independent Eurotech-run Honda Civic of Jeff Smith claimed
                second. Smith topped FP2 for much of the running but also had to
                recover from an off-track moment on the very next lap after
                setting his benchmark.
              </p>
              <p class="content-text">
                Despite dropping to second at the finish, Smith was delighted
                with his progress. I’m really pleased with that, he enthused. I
                had a bit of a scary moment at the jump after having an off but
                we won’t dwell on that. The pace is in the car but I actually
                think there’s more to come from me so that bodes well for this
                afternoon.

                Smith wasn’t the only driver to return to the track relatively
                unscathed after a spin as both the Honda of Matt Neal and Ford
                Focus of Alex Martin also endured moments during the session.

                West Surrey Racing again showed well in third, fifth and seventh
                respectively with championship challenger Sam Tordoff getting
                the better of his more experienced team-mates Andy Priaulx and
                Rob Collard.

                Mat Jackson and Andrew Jordan proved that they’ll be in the mix

                Morgan again left it late to fire his Mercedes A-Class up the
                order while Plato’s Team BMR RCIB Insurance squad admits it may
                not be setting the ultimate pace this weekend. Speedworks again
                broke into the leading ten with Ingram, but its achilles heel
                seems to be getting much beyond that. Qualifying will determine
                whether Ingram can haul his Toyota Avensis into the fight for a
                top six grid berth.
